GENERAL USAGE NOTES
--------------------
- This includes the Matlab code and birdsong examples presented in
  "Birdsong Denoising Using Wavelets" published in PLOS One Journal. 

- We used Matlab R2014a and the Matlab Wavelet Toolbox. You will 
  be able to use an earlier version of Matlab, but no guarantee.

- Be aware that it takes some time to denoise depending on 
  the speed and memory capacity of your computer.

- To view the spectrogrms and listen to the sounds you can use 
  any suitable sound analysis software 
  (for example Praat is a free s/w - http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)
